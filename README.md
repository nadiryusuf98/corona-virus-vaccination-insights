## Project overview
Stay informed about the global progress in COVID-19 vaccinations with our comprehensive tracker. We focus exclusively on countries actively engaged in vaccination campaigns, providing real-time updates on vaccination rates and distribution. the effects of GDP on Vaccination rate is also highlighted in this project.

## Data sources

the primary data source for this project is from Our world in Data: "Owid-covid-data-2.csv" file. This dataset contains all the necessary data on vaccinations across the globe.

## Tools
-Excel: Cleaning and extracting the necessary data on vaccination rate

-Tableau: Creating a Detailed dashboard

## Data Cleaning and Preparation


In the intial data preperation stage, I performed the following tasks:

1.Data loading and Inspection

2.Handling missing values

3.Data cleaning and formating

4.Visual Checking for Data Quality


## Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Which country has the highest % of their population fully vaccinated?
2. which country has the lowest % of their population fully vaccinated?
3. The effects of GDP per capita on vaccination rates.
4. the % share of the population that are partially vaccinated Vs the % share of the population that are fully vaccinated.


## Data Analysis
Interesting features I Used:

## Results and Findings

1.  29.4% of the world population are not vaccinated against the Corona Virus.
2.  Burundi is the country with the lowest % of its population vaccinated againts the corona virus.
3.  Positvie correlation between GDP per Capti and vaccination rate.
4.  Qatar and Gibraltar are one of the countries with the highest % of its population vaccinated against covid-19 compared to the rest of the world.

## Recommendations

Visualize Global Vaccination Progress: Utilize interactive charts and graphs available on Our World in Data to visualize the progress of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns across different countries and regions. Highlight key metrics such as total doses administered, vaccination rates per capita, and the percentage of the population fully vaccinated.

Analyze Vaccine Distribution Equity: Investigate disparities in vaccine distribution and access using demographic data provided by Our World in Data. Analyze vaccination coverage among different population groups, including age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, to identify areas requiring targeted interventions to promote equity.

Monitor Vaccine Effectiveness Over Time: Track the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing transmission rates, hospitalizations, and mortality using real-world data available on Our World in Data. Conduct longitudinal analysis to assess the long-term efficacy of different vaccine types and identify any emerging trends or challenges.

Identify Regional Hotspots and Trends: Use geospatial analysis tools provided by Our World in Data to identify regional hotspots with low vaccination coverage or high transmission rates. Monitor trends in vaccine distribution and COVID-19 incidence over time to inform targeted intervention strategies and resource allocation.

Evaluate Policy Impacts and Lessons Learned: Evaluate the impact of vaccination policies and strategies implemented by different countries and regions using policy evaluation tools available on Our World in Data. Identify successful approaches and lessons learned to inform evidence-based decision-making and support global efforts to control the pandemic.

By implementing these recommendations, you can conduct a comprehensive analysis of the global COVID-19 vaccine tracker using data from Our World in Data, providing valuable insights to support public health efforts and inform evidence-based decision-making worldwide.






## Limitations

Data Reporting Discrepancies: Data on COVID-19 vaccination rates and distribution may vary in accuracy and timeliness due to discrepancies in reporting practices among different countries and regions. Some countries may have more robust reporting systems than others, leading to potential gaps or inconsistencies in the data.

Data Lag and Updates: There may be a lag in the availability of data updates on Our World in Data, particularly for real-time or near-real-time information on vaccination campaigns. This can affect the accuracy and completeness of your analysis, especially when monitoring rapidly evolving situations such as new vaccine approvals or distribution challenges.

Data Quality and Reliability: While Our World in Data strives to provide high-quality and reliable data, there may still be limitations in the accuracy and completeness of the information available. Data may be subject to errors, omissions, or revisions, particularly when sourced from multiple sources or aggregated from different datasets.

Limited Granularity: The granularity of data available on Our World in Data may vary depending on the source and scope of the information. Some datasets may provide only aggregated statistics at the national or regional level, limiting the ability to analyze vaccination trends and disparities at a more detailed level, such as sub-national or community levels.

Contextual Factors and Interpretation: Data on COVID-19 vaccination rates and distribution must be interpreted within the context of broader social, economic, and political factors influencing public health outcomes. Our World in Data may not always provide comprehensive contextual information or metadata to facilitate nuanced analysis and interpretation of the data.

By acknowledging these limitations and taking steps to mitigate their impact, such as cross-referencing data with multiple sources and conducting sensitivity analyses, you can enhance the robustness and reliability of your COVID-19 vaccine tracker project using Our World in Data.
